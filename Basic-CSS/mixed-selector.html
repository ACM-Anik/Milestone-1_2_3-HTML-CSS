This us my first blog. Its just begin.</h3></p> 
<p class="green">Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about. Life is a long lesson in humility.In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on. Love the life you live. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.</p>

    <p><b>1</b> The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. -<span class="yellow">Nelson Mandela</span><br>
   2 The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. -Walt Disney <br>
   3 Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma- which is living with the results of other people's thinking. -<span class="yellow"> Steve Jobs</span> <br>
   4 If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor. -<span class="yellow">Eleanor Roosevelt</span> <br>
   5 If you look at what you have in life, you'll always have more. If you look at what you don't have in life, you'll never have enough. -<span class="yellow">Oprah Winfrey</span> <br>
   6 If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success. - <span class="yellow"> James Cameron</span> <br>
   7 Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. - <span class="yellow"> John Lennon</p></span>
